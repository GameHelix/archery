3. **Use text-gray-300 or lighter** for body text
4. **Use text-white or text-gray-100** for headings
5. **Test contrast ratios** before committing changes
6. **Use semi-transparent backgrounds** (e.g., `bg-purple-500/20`) for accents

### Quick Reference

/* ✅ Good - Visible on Dark Backgrounds */
text-white, text-gray-100, text-gray-200, text-gray-300
text-green-400, text-blue-400, text-yellow-400, text-red-400
bg-dark-800, bg-dark-700, bg-purple-500/20

/* ❌ Bad - Invisible on Dark Backgrounds */
text-gray-900, text-gray-800, text-gray-700, text-gray-600
